It will generate a QR Code for each system and store the generated QR codes in a directory called QRCodes. 
While generating the QR Code, at the bottom of the QR Code, the System ID will be printed to identify the QR Code and attest it to the appropriate System. 
Upon scanning that QR Code, it will display all the information related to that system (such as System ID, CPU, Memory, Disk, GPU, Display, Keyboard Brand, Keyboard ID, Mouse Brand, and Mouse ID).
It will make use of phpqrcode &  phpspreadsheet libraries.
